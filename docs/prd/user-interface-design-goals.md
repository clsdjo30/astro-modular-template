# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
- CLI-first, preset-driven flow with minimal prompts and explicit, predictable outputs.
- Generated code is easy to read and modify manually; no hidden magic.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- Plain prompt-based CLI wizard for create with flags.
- add and remove with clear ownership warnings; no TUI.

## Core Screens and Views
- CLI onboarding/selection flow
- Preset/module list and help output
- Generated project README (quickstart + module list)
- Vitrine and blog pages (frontend output)
- Restaurant catalog, cart, and checkout pages (frontend output)

## Accessibility
- WCAG AA

## Branding
- Neutral/minimal defaults; no branded theme.

## Target Device and Platforms
- Web Responsive
