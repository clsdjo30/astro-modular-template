# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Produce a preset-first Astro template + CLI that generates clean, minimal projects in minutes.
- Maintain strict module boundaries so selected features add no dead code or unused deps.
- Support static-first outputs with an explicit hybrid/SSR path for backend-enabled presets.
- Provide a complete internal baseline for freelancer reuse, including restaurant commerce flows.
- Keep the template framework-agnostic and production-ready by default (lint/typecheck/build).

## Background Context
This is an internal productivity foundation for a solo freelancer repeatedly building similar Astro sites. Current workflows involve re-wiring SEO, content, forms, and deployment for each client, causing time loss and inconsistency. Existing starters are either too generic or too opinionated, so the solution must generate minimal outputs while still supporting more complex, backend-enabled features when explicitly selected.
