# MVP Validation Plan
- Success is achieved when vitrine/blog/restaurant presets can be generated in under 10 minutes, pass CI on first run, and the commerce flow completes end-to-end using the API + session cart.
- Collect internal feedback after first two client projects: setup time, manual edits count, and friction points.
- Exit v1 when: bootstrap time target is met, CLI add/remove works for owned files, and the product -> cart -> checkout flow is stable for at least one real client use case.
