# Story 3.4: Forms Module (Static-Friendly)

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** solo freelancer,  
**I want** a contact form module compatible with static hosting,  
**so that** client sites can capture leads without a custom backend.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Forms module provides a contact form page and reusable form component.
2. Form integration uses a single concrete provider in v1 (no multi-provider support).
3. Forms module injects into an existing Contact page via patch-points (no competing route).
4. Form submission is static-only HTML behavior (no JS, no backend).

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Define forms module composition (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [ ] Create module manifest in `packages/modules/forms/manifest.yaml`.
  - [ ] Declare owned files and patch insertions per the module schema.
  - [ ] Add documentation entries for the module.
- [ ] Add form UI assets (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Add `templates/modules/forms/src/components/forms/ContactForm.astro`.
  - [ ] Add a patch-point block to inject the form into the existing contact page.
  - [ ] Keep markup minimal and accessible (labels, required fields, error hints placeholder).
- [ ] Add provider integration (AC: 2, 4)
  - [ ] Use Formspree (static-friendly) as the single v1 provider.
  - [ ] Add `modules.forms.actionUrl` config key (no provider switch in v1).
  - [ ] Render a plain HTML `<form>` with `action` and `method="POST"` (no JS).
  - [ ] Include a note to add hidden fields required by the provider.
- [ ] Verify static-only output (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Ensure no backend deps or frameworks are introduced.
  - [ ] Run `pnpm build` for static output (base template).

## Dev Notes
### Architecture References
- Module schema and ownership rules. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Critical Fullstack Rules]
- Repo structure: modules in `packages/modules/`, templates in `templates/`. [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#Unified Project Structure]
- Static-first output and no framework by default. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack Table]

### Dependencies
- Story 1.1 (base template structure and layout).
- Story 2.1 (module manifest schema).
- Story 2.2 (patch-point conventions).
- Story 2.4 (docs generation).

### Scope Boundaries (v1)
- Static-only submission (no serverless function or backend).
- No multi-provider support in v1 (Formspree only).
- No JS-enhanced validation beyond HTML attributes.

### File Locations
- Module manifest: `packages/modules/forms/manifest.yaml`
- Module templates: `templates/modules/forms/`

## Testing
Relevant standards from architecture:
- Template tests optional; ensure `pnpm build` succeeds. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Testing Strategy]
- No framework dependencies required. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack Table]
Manual verification:
- Confirm form action URL is wired from config.
- Confirm form component renders in static pages.
