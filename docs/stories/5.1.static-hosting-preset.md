# Story 5.1: Static Hosting Preset

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** solo freelancer,  
**I want** a static hosting preset,  
**so that** I can deploy static Astro sites quickly and reliably.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Static preset produces `dist/` with no Node runtime required in production.
2. Preset documentation includes build and deploy steps for generic static hosting.
3. CI scripts validate lint, typecheck, astro check, and build.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Define static hosting preset (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Create preset metadata in `templates/presets/static/`.
  - [ ] Document build output path (`dist/`) and static-only requirement.
- [ ] Add deployment guidance (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Add docs with build + deploy steps for generic static hosting (upload `dist/`).
  - [ ] Include environment variable policy summary (PUBLIC_ only for client).
- [ ] Ensure CI baseline present (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Confirm scripts exist: `lint`, `typecheck`, `astro check`, `build`.

## Dev Notes
### Architecture References
- Static-first output and no framework by default. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack Table]
- Deployment guidance for static hosting. [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md#Frontend Deployment]
- CI baseline requirements. [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md#CI Pipeline (Generator Repo vs Generated Projects)]

### Dependencies
- Story 1.3 (CI baseline).

### Scope Boundaries (v1)
- No platform-specific adapters in this story.
- No SSR/hybrid in this preset.

### File Locations
- Preset metadata: `templates/presets/static/`
- Docs: `docs/`

## Testing
Relevant standards from architecture:
- CI should run lint/typecheck/astro check/build. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Testing Strategy]
Manual verification:
- Build output is static in `dist/`.
