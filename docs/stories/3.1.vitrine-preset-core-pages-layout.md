# Story 3.1: Vitrine Preset (Core Pages + Layout)

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** solo freelancer,  
**I want** a vitrine preset with core marketing pages and a neutral layout,  
**so that** I can ship static marketing sites quickly.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Vitrine preset provides Home (from base), About, Services, and Contact pages with explicit routes and filenames.
2. Pages use the shared neutral layout from the base template (no new themed layout in the preset).
3. Neutral layout definition: simple header/footer, single-column content, neutral typography, no brand colors; includes headings, landmarks, and a skip link.
4. No JS framework is required by default.
5. Static build succeeds with no backend dependencies.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Define vitrine preset composition (AC: 1, 2, 5)
  - [ ] Create preset metadata in `templates/presets/vitrine/`.
  - [ ] Reference base template and add required pages only in preset scope.
  - [ ] Use a YAML preset manifest named `preset.yaml` in `templates/presets/vitrine/`.
- [ ] Add core marketing pages (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [ ] Explicit routes and filenames:
    - `/` -> `templates/base/src/pages/index.astro` (base template)
    - `/about` -> `templates/presets/vitrine/src/pages/about.astro`
    - `/services` -> `templates/presets/vitrine/src/pages/services.astro`
    - `/contact` -> `templates/presets/vitrine/src/pages/contact.astro`
  - [ ] Use the base layout (`templates/base/src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`) in all vitrine pages.
  - [ ] Ensure neutral layout definition and accessible structure are reflected in page markup.
- [ ] Verify static-only output (AC: 4, 5)
  - [ ] Ensure no backend deps or frameworks are introduced.
  - [ ] Run `pnpm build` for static output (base template).

## Dev Notes
### Architecture References
- Base page and component structure: `src/pages/` and layout components. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#Component Architecture]
- Repo structure: presets in `templates/presets/`, base in `templates/base/`. [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#Unified Project Structure]
- Neutral UI and no framework by default. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack Table]
- Accessibility baseline (WCAG AA) in UI goals. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#Component Architecture]

### Dependencies
- Story 1.1 (base template structure and layout).
- Story 2.1 (YAML manifest conventions for presets).

### Scope Boundaries (v1)
- Base template provides shared layout and default pages (home + 404).  
- Vitrine preset adds marketing pages only (about/services/contact) and minimal content.
- No blog, forms, or SEO additions in this story.

### File Locations
- Preset metadata: `templates/presets/vitrine/`  
- Base pages: `templates/base/src/pages/`  
- Preset pages: `templates/presets/vitrine/src/pages/`

## Testing
Relevant standards from architecture:
- Template tests optional; ensure `pnpm build` succeeds. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Testing Strategy]
- No framework dependencies required. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack Table]
Manual verification:
- Confirm preset page files exist in `templates/presets/vitrine/src/pages/` with correct routes.
- Spot-check markup for layout and accessibility requirements.
