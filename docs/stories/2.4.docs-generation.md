# Story 2.4: Docs Generation

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** solo freelancer,  
**I want** module documentation generated from manifests,  
**so that** docs stay in sync with the system.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. CLI generates a module catalog (MODULES.md) from manifests.
2. CLI generates an enable/disable guide (CONFIG.md or similar).
3. Generated docs include module dependencies and conflicts.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Define doc outputs and content (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [ ] Use output paths `docs/MODULES.md` and `docs/CONFIG.md`.
  - [ ] Define required fields: module id, description, dependencies, conflicts, config keys.
- [ ] Implement docs generation in CLI (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [ ] Read manifests from `packages/modules/`.
  - [ ] Render markdown tables/lists for MODULES and CONFIG.
  - [ ] Include dependency/conflict fields in output.
- [ ] Add tests for docs generation (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [ ] Unit tests for renderer output.
  - [ ] Integration test using real YAML manifest validated by Zod schema.

## Dev Notes
### Architecture References
- Manifests live in `packages/modules` and are consumed by CLI in `packages/cli`. [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#Unified Project Structure]
- Zod validation in `packages/shared` for manifest schema. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Critical Fullstack Rules]
- Testing: CLI requires unit + integration tests. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Test Organization]

### File Locations
- CLI docs generation: `packages/cli/`  
- Manifests: `packages/modules/`  
- Shared schema/types: `packages/shared/`  
- Output docs: `docs/`  

## Testing
Relevant standards from architecture:
- CLI requires unit + integration tests. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Test Organization]
- Use Vitest 2.0.0. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack Table]
