# Story 5.3: Deployment Docs & Handoff

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** solo freelancer,  
**I want** reusable deployment docs and client handoff guidance,  
**so that** delivery is consistent and low-maintenance.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Deployment docs cover static hosting and o2switch API hosting paths.
2. Handoff docs include setup, environment variables, and maintenance notes.
3. Docs are modular and generated or composed per preset where applicable.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Add deployment documentation (AC: 1)
  - [x] Write static hosting steps (build + upload `dist/`).
  - [x] Write o2switch API deployment steps (Node version, start command, env vars).
- [x] Add handoff documentation (AC: 2, 3)
  - [x] Include setup checklist and required env vars.
  - [x] Add a minimal maintenance checklist (backups, log rotation, updates).
  - [x] Ensure docs can be included per preset/module selection.
- [x] Verify docs structure (AC: 3)
  - [x] Ensure docs live under `docs/` and are referenced in README.
