# Story 4.2: Internal Auth Module (Minimal, Extensible)

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** solo freelancer,  
**I want** internal auth with email/password and sessions/JWT,  
**so that** access is self-hosted and controllable.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Auth supports email/password login and session handling.
2. Roles are supported (admin/customer) with endpoint protection.
3. Auth design allows optional OAuth providers later without refactoring core flows.
4. No full back-office admin UI is required in v1 (optional minimal view orders page only).

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Add auth routes and controllers (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Implement `POST /api/v1/auth/login`, `POST /api/v1/auth/logout`, `GET /api/v1/auth/me`.
  - [ ] Keep `POST /api/v1/auth/register` disabled by default in v1.
  - [ ] Add Zod validation for auth payloads.
- [ ] Add auth service and password hashing (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Use Argon2id for password hashing and verification.
  - [ ] Add user repository methods for lookup by email.
  - [ ] Ensure session creation/rotation on login.
- [ ] Add session middleware and role guards (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Use `express-session` with `express-mysql-session` in production and in-memory store in dev.
  - [ ] Add `requireAuth` and `requireRole("admin")` middleware.
  - [ ] Keep roles as enum `"admin" | "customer"` (no RBAC table in v1).
- [ ] Document extensibility (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Note how to add OAuth later without changing core auth flow (hook point in auth service).

### Dependencies
- Story 4.1 (API skeleton + middleware structure).

### Scope Boundaries (v1)
- No OAuth providers implemented in v1.
- No full admin UI (optional minimal orders page is outside API scope).

### File Locations
- Routes: `packages/api/src/routes/auth.routes.ts`
- Controllers: `packages/api/src/controllers/auth.controller.ts`
- Services: `packages/api/src/services/auth.service.ts`
- Middleware: `packages/api/src/middleware/auth.middleware.ts`, `role.middleware.ts`

## Testing
Relevant standards from architecture:
- Backend integration tests in `packages/api`. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Test Organization]
Manual verification:
- Login returns session cookie and `GET /api/v1/auth/me` responds with user.
- Logout clears session.
